'''Polymorphism

inheritance: class Radio inherits the turn_on() method from its superclass â€” that is why we see The device was turned
on string twice. Other subclasses override that method and as a result we see different lines being printed;

polymorphism: all class instances allow the calling of the turn_on() method, even when you refer to the objects using 
the arbitrary variable element.
'''

#To briefly demonstrate polymorphism on integers and strings, we execute the following code:

a = 10
print(a.__add__(20))
b = 'abc'
print(b.__add__('def'))

#Below is the code implementing both inheritance and polymorphism:

class Device:
    def turn_on(self):
        print("The device was turned on")

class Radio(Device):
    pass

class PortableRadio(Device):
    def turn_on(self):
        print('PortableRadio type object was turned on')

class TvSet(Device):
    def turn_on(self):
        print('TvSet type object was turned on') 
    
device = Device()
radio = Radio()
portableRadio = PortableRadio()
tvset = TvSet()

for element in (device, radio, portableRadio, tvset):
    element.turn_on()



print()
'''Second way to achive polymorphism is by dack-typing

* Both the Wax and Cheese classes own melt() methods, but there is no relation between the two. 
* Thanks to duck typing, we can call the melt() method. Unfortunatelly, the Wood class is not equipped
    with this method, so an AttributeError exception occurs.

class Wax:
    def melt(self):
        print("Wax can be used to form a tool")

class Cheese:
    def melt(self):
        print("Cheese can be eaten")

class Wood:
    def fire(self):
        print("A fire has been started!")

for element in Wax(), Cheese(), Wood():
    try:
        element.melt()
    except AttributeError:
        print("No melt() method")
